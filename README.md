## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a language model that generates movie overviews using the TMDB API. We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the movie overviews and fine-tune a language model for text generation.

## Conclusion

In this project, we successfully fetched movie overviews from the TMDB API, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and built a language model to generate movie overviews. The WordCloud visualization provided insights into the most common words used in the overviews. This project showcases the potential of language models in generating creative text based on existing data.
